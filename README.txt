Install
--------

After installing the android apk, close the app. 
A new 'share' option "Wikimedia Commons" is then available within the menu options when viewing a stored image on the mobile. From here, the app is started automatically when selected. Do not start the app from another location.


How to use
----------
Chose a locally stored image on the SD card or memory picture (from the gallery), or just view the latest picture you made. Using the share menu button, and selecting Commons, the image can be shared (uploaded) to Commons. A correct username and password must be provided the first time only. Login settings are stored locally.

A simple file name is suggested (username plus local filename), and a file description can be entered (default empty). Existing files on Commons with the same proposed filename are not overwritten.

The app is closed directly after an upload.
